# zpy

This is my attempt at building a Python LSP from scratch with no dependencies in Zig.

My goals are:
- Learn Zig and get comfortable with it. 
- Gain a better understanding of the weird and dark corners of Python
- Learn more about compiler architecture
- Have fun

My far-stretched goal is to eventually replace PyRight in my own editor with this, just to see how it performs. I'm very far away from that at the moment though.


## TODO

- Benchmark against real python projects (tokens per second, time to AST)
- CI
